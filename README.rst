GIMME is an XMMS2 client for Emacs currently being developed for
Google's Summer of Code. You can read more about it at
http://scorciapino.com/blog/archives/49, which has some mockups, too.

Pomodoros
---------

I wonder how much time I'll end up dedicating to GIMME...

* **29/4**: 5 pomodoros building a simple ruby+emacs example
* **30/4**: 1 pomodoro installing xmms and its libs in this machine
* **03/5**: 3 pomodoros wresting with output plugins and 3 pomodoros
    wrestling with an ugly macro :(


TODO
----

* Read about processes on `Emacs's manual`_.
* Fix paredit and flyspell modes
* Etc
