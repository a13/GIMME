GIMME is an XMMS2 client for Emacs currently being developed for
Google's Summer of Code. You can read more about it at
http://scorciapino.com/blog/archives/49, which has some mockups, too.

Pomodoros
---------

I wonder how much time I'll end up dedicating to GIMME...

* **29/4**: 5 pomodoros building a simple ruby+emacs example
* **30/4**: 1 pomodoro installing xmms and its libs in this machine
* **03/5**: 6 pomodoros: 3 wresting with output plugins and 3 wrestling with an ugly macro :(
* **06/5**: 3 pomodoros watching Ruby screencasts on metaprogramming
* **07/5**: 6 pomodoros: 3 watching ruby screencasts and 3 working on code


TODO et Next Steps
------------------

* Read about processes on `Emacs's manual`_. (est. 2 pom)
* Fix paredit and flyspell modes (est. 1 pom)
* Finish Ruby screencasts (est. 4 pom)
* Study the sexp library (est. 2 pom)
