* To be done
  - [ ] Rewrite the sort calls on lyrics.rb using max_by or inject!
  - [ ] The update broadcast changes the format of the updated tracks
  - [ ] Group the facets?
  - [ ] Some functions take optional arguments, and some other have
	auxiliary functions.
  - [ ] I'm using single quotes all the time. I don't think it's gonna
	play well with tags that include it
  - [ ] Remove the FIXMEs and put them all here
  - [ ] Is autocompletion scaling for 10k tracks? See https://github.com/rails/auto_complete
  - [ ] A nil in every part of gimme-mlib-overview?
* Bugs [0/3]
  - [ ] Saving/changing a lot of songs in the tagwriter is slow.
  - [ ] The broadcast function is sometimes returning a wrong value
        for the :timesplayed property. Fix'd for medialib_changed but
        not for the other.
