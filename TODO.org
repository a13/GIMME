* To be done
  - Rewrite the sort calls on lyrics.rb using max_by or inject!
  - The update broadcast changes the format of the updated tracks
  - Group the facets?
  - Some functions take optional arguments, and some other have
    auxiliary functions.
  - I'm using single quotes all the time. I don't think it's gonna
    play well with tags that include it
  - Remove the FIXMEs and put them all here
  - Is autocompletion scaling for 10k tracks? See https://github.com/rails/auto_complete
  - A nil in every part of gimme-mlib-overview?
  - Improve the niche lyrics fetcher
  - Equalizer presets
  - Radio list
  - Replace for local variables the bunch of global variables that
    are there whenever possible
  - Change gimme-filter for something more appropriate
  - Autocomplete: Make the *GIMME Completions* buffer scroll
  - Saving/changing a lot of songs in the tagwriter is slow.
  - The broadcast function is sometimes returning a wrong value for
    the :timesplayed property. Fix'd for medialib_changed but not for
    the other.
  - Weird stuff get copied to the clipboard sometimes
