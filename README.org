* Status and next steps
  
  Filter-view now partially works!

  Next Steps:
  1. Finish working on filter-views's functions (filter-view)
  2. Write a preliminary version of Tree-view (tree-view)
  3. Mess around with coloring and a mini-language for displaying the songs (playlist)
  4. Blog post (Etc)
  5. Colorize the songs (filter view)
  6. Refactor the code (Etc)
     
  Filter View:
  1. Work on some rudimentary alternative way of displaying the songs on the collection (perhaps by grouping them?)
  2. Colorize the songs
  3. Better presentation of the current collection
  4. Allow complex search criteria
  5. Finish working on filter-views's functions (filter-view)
     
  Tree View:
  1. Write a preliminary version of Tree-view

  Playlist View:
  1. Implement the move operation on the playlist-updated broadcast
  3. Mess around with coloring and a mini-language for displaying the songs
  4. Recreate the undo function
  5. Recreate the kill/yank region functions
  7. Deal with multiple instances of a song (see gimme-update-tags etc)
  8. Create some sort of debouncer to remove the unnecessary extra calls to gimme-update-tags

  Etc:
  1. Blog post
  2. Refactor the code

* Info
  GIMME is an XMMS2 client for Emacs currently being developed for
  Google's Summer of Code. You can read more about it at
  http://scorciapino.com/blog/archives/49, which has some mockups, too.

  It uses [[http://rubyforge.org/projects/sexp/][S-Expression]], a Ruby Library to deal with sexps.

  I wonder how much time I'll end up dedicating to GIMME...
