* Status and next steps

  Now it's almost usable! Still some bugs, but quite frankly, I'm
  using it! 

  1. Finish working on the playlist-updated broadcast
  2. Refactor the code
  3. Fix the bug involving adding a, eg, .txt file using another
     client
  4. Mess around with coloring and a mini-language for displaying the
     songs
  5. Create a debug buffer
  6. Blog post
     
* Info
  GIMME is an XMMS2 client for Emacs currently being developed for
  Google's Summer of Code. You can read more about it at
  http://scorciapino.com/blog/archives/49, which has some mockups, too.

  It uses [[http://rubyforge.org/projects/sexp/][S-Expression]], a Ruby Library to deal with sexps
