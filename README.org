* Status and next steps
  
  Filter View:
  1. Better Completion
  2. NOT
  3. Escape quotes properly
     
  Tree View:
  1. Org-mode coloring
  2. Storing collections on 
  3. Operations on Trees

  Playlist View:
  1. Tickle, messages and hooks

  Bugs:
  1. Spaces on filter view's search

  Wishlist:
  1. Work on some rudimentary alternative way of displaying the songs on the collection (perhaps by grouping them?)
  2. More than one buffer
  3. Colorize the header
  4. Recreate the kill/yank region functions
  5. Implement the move operation on the playlist-updated broadcast
  6. Deal with multiple instances of a song (see gimme-update-tags etc)
  7. Create some sort of debouncer to remove the unnecessary extra calls to gimme-update-tags

     
* Info
  GIMME is an XMMS2 client for Emacs currently being developed for
  Google's Summer of Code. You can read more about it at
  http://scorciapino.com/blog/archives/49, which has some mockups, too.

  It uses [[http://rubyforge.org/projects/sexp/][S-Expression]], a Ruby Library to deal with sexps.

  I wonder how much time I'll end up dedicating to GIMME...
