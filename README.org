* Info
  GIMME is an XMMS2 client for Emacs currently being developed for
  Google's Summer of Code. You can read more about it at
  http://scorciapino.com/blog/archives/49, which has some mockups, too.

  It uses [[http://rubyforge.org/projects/sexp/][S-Expression]], a Ruby Library to deal with sexps.

* Known bugs
  - When you delete the currently playing song, the playlist state
    gets inconsistent on the server
  - Sometimes when you jump to another view, the buffer is displayed
    without colors until you press a key. Perhaps an Emacs issue?

* Pomodoros
